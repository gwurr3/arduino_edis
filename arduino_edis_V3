// edis controller code.
// Strategy is to make a 2d array, one being rpm, the other being tps, with no hard-coded rpm or tps 
//   information, just a slope/offset/digitization into each one.  (maybe compute as a 0-1 function, 
//   then multiply by the number of rows and columns, then turn into an integer and read that row or column.)

// (ford edis) pip is every tooth, so 36 times per revolution.  At 6000 rpm, that's 3600 pulses per second.
// Measured interval in milliseconds will range from 120mS for 500 rpm to 6mS for 10,000 rpm. 

// HOWEVER! the ford edis module provides a tach output, once per revolution, so at 6000 rpm that's 100 pulses per
//  second.  Way better.

// program continuously reads throttle position.  When a negative interrupt from tach is caught, store microseconds, 
//  then the array number (which is the pause time in microseconds) is retrieved.  Pin set high, 
//  delay for required edis signal pause time, pin set low, exit interrupt.  This is blocking but
//  as it should exit far before next interrupt, and timer counter is separate hardware, it should
//  not block anything.

// SAW ranges from 64 to 1792 microseconds with max resolution of 4 microseconds.  That's 432 steps.  
//    If I use 8 microsecond resolution I can just use ints to store my table (although I have so much 
//    space I could use longs.)
//    I would have to multiply the result by four if I go with ints.  If I go with longs I get to use 
//    all the resolution and don't have to multiply -- values would directly reflect the pause times.

// I could also store the degrees advance in the table, then multiply to generate the values, but why?  
//   I can back-calculate that if necessary.  It would make debug for other people easier.

// it is likely that the best way to store the table itself is in external rom.  For initial development probably
//  stored in external flash or eeprom.
