// edis controller code.
// pip is every tooth, so 36 times per revolution.  At 6000 rpm, that's 3600 pulses per second.
// Strategy is to make a 2d array, one being rpm, the other being load, with no hard-coded rpm or load information, just
// a slope/offset/digitization into each one.  (maybe compute as a 0-1 function, then multiply by the number of rows and columns, 
// then turn into an integer and read that row or column.)

// Measured milliseconds will range from 120mS for 500 rpm to 6mS for 10,000 rpm.  36 interrupts per rotation means at 
//  500 rpm, 3.33mS between interrupts, at 10,000 rpm, 0.167mS between interrupts.
// may want to do int(mS*100)

// program continuously reads throttle position.  When a negative interrupt is caught, store microseconds, then the array number 
//  (which is the pause time in microseconds) is retrieved.  Pin set high, delay for pause time, pin set low, exit interrupt.

// SAW ranges from 64 to 1792 microseconds with max resolution of 4 microseconds.  That's 432 steps.  If I use 8 microsecond resolution
// I can just use ints to store my table (although I have so much space I could use longs.)
// I would have to multiply the result by four if I go with ints.  If I go with longs I get to use all the resolution and don't have
// to multiply -- values would directly reflect the pause times.

// I could also store the degrees advance in the table, then multiply to generate the values, but why?  I can back-calculate that
// if necessary.
